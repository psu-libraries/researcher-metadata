## API
### Gems
This API is intended to conform to the Swagger 2.0 specification. As such, we're leveraging several gems to simplify the API development workflow, but remain true to the Swagger/Open API standard:
- **swagger-blocks**: a DSL for pure Ruby code blocks that can be turned into JSON (what we're using to generate our API file which will then be used to generate interactive documentation).
- **apivore**: tests a rails API against its OpenAPI (Swagger) description of end-points, models, and query parameters.
- **swagger_ui_engine**: serves up live, interactive API documentation as part of our site. Basically provides a sandbox where users can read about the enpoints and then "try them out". It builds all of this from the API file we build from swagger-blocks.
- **fast_jsonapi**: is what we're using for serialization.

### Suggested API Development Workflow
- Document the new endpoint using the swagger-blocks DSL. Pro tip: Until you get the hang of the DSL, you can use the [interactive swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) for guidance and to check that you have valid Swagger 2.0. Try it out by pasting in the current API file as a starting point: ``` pbcopy < public/api_docs/swagger_docs/v1/swagger.json ``` 
- Once you've got valid Swagger documentation of the new endpoint, you can start TDD'ing beginning with an **apivore** spec. See: ```spec/requests/api/v1/swagger_checker_spec.rb```. The apivore spec will test against the API JSON file, so you'll need to generate a new one each time you update your swagger-blocks DSL documentation. We have a rake task for doing so: ```rake swagger_api_docs:generate_json_file```.
- In addition to the apivore spec, we've also been using request specs to "integration" test our endpoints and params. See: ```spec/requests/api/v1/users_spec.rb``` for an example. The apivore specs are good for ensuring the DSL/documentation jives with the actual enpoints, but the request specs allow us to be more thorough.
- Once specs are passing it's a good idea to manually test the endpoint using the swagger-ui: ```/api_docs/swagger_docs/v1```
