<p>
  Hello,
</p>

<p>
  We are writing to follow up on the publication file(s) uploaded to your account in Activity Insight in the
   section titled “Open Access Post-Print Publication files."
</p>

<p>
  When researchers <a href="https://openaccess.psu.edu/deposit/activity-insight/">upload files to this section</a>,
  a team in the Libraries works to make them available to the public via
  <a href="http://scholarsphere.psu.edu/">ScholarSphere</a> according to the default terms of the journal's
  publishing agreement. This process is designed for the
  <a href="https://psu.libanswers.com/faq/273465">“post-print” or “accepted manuscript” version</a> of the article,
  because most journals allow that version to be shared widely. Some journals prefer that you share the final
  published version.
</p>

<p>
  One or more of the files you (or an Activity Insight Proxy) uploaded appear to be a version of the article
  that the journal's default policy does not allow to be deposited in ScholarSphere. If you have the version of
  an article that can be deposited, you can send it by reply email or upload it in Activity Insight. Here is a
  summary of what we have and what we need:
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead class='card-header'>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Version we have</th>
      <th>Version that can be deposited</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class='card-body'>
    <% @publications.each do |p| %>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <%= p.title %>
        </td>
        <td>
          <%= p.activity_insight_oa_files.first.version_status_display %>
        </td>
        <td>
          <%= p.preferred_version_display %>
        </td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  You can view a list of all your publications and their open access statuses on your
  <a href="https://metadata.libraries.psu.edu/profile/publications/edit">Manage Profile Publications</a>
  page. If you have uploaded other files in Activity Insight, we will process those files and update you in due course.
</p>
