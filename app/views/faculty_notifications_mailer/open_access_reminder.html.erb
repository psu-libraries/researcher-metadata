<p>Dear <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>
  Penn State Policy AC02: Open Access to Scholarly Articles, requires university researchers
  to provide the accepted manuscript version of their scholarly articles to the University
  Libraries to be made available to the public free of charge. Researchers who cannot or do
  not wish to make a particular article freely available can obtain a waiver. The policy went
  into effect on January 1, 2020 after endorsement by Faculty Senate and approval by the
  President’s Council and <%= link_to "does not apply to some articles", "https://psu.libanswers.com/faq/279964" %>
  with publishing agreements signed before that date.
</p>

<p>
  We have identified one or more publications published since July 1, 2020 for which you are
  listed as an author. We have not found an open access version of these publications. For
  items on the list that are <%= link_to "scholarly articles", "https://psu.libanswers.com/faq/279967" %>,
  we encourage you to visit the links in the list below and follow the instructions to provide your
  <%= link_to "accepted manuscript", "https://psu.libanswers.com/faq/279953" %> or obtain a waiver
  of the policy.
