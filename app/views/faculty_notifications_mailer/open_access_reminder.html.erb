<p>Dear <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>
  Penn State Policy AC02: Open Access to Scholarly Articles, requires university researchers to 
  provide the accepted manuscript version of their scholarly articles to the University Libraries
  to be made available to the public free of charge. Researchers who cannot or do not wish to 
  make a particular article freely available can obtain a waiver. The policy went into effect on
  January 1, 2020 after endorsement by Faculty Senate and approval by the Presidentâ€™s Council.
</p>

<p>
  We have identified one or more recent articles for which you are listed as an author that may
  be subject to the policy. We have not found an open access version of these articles. We
  encourage you to visit the links in the list and follow the instructions to provide your
  accepted manuscript or obtain a waiver of the policy.
